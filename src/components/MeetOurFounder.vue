                            Founded by Ken in 2021, Kreassi Team was born from a mission to help brands grow
                            with clarity, creativity, and structure. With a background in creative strategy and a
                            transformational leadership approach, Ken has built an agency where collaboration,
                            trust, and growth are at the core.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Believing that great leadership empowers others to lead, Ken shaped Kreassi Team
                            into more than just a service provider — it’s a partner in brand building. Under his
                            guidance, Kreassi Team has supported over <strong>50+</strong> businesses across
                            Indonesia, delivering impactful digital solutions with speed and purpose.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2025, Ken began expanding internationally — starting with
                            <strong> Sydney, Australia</strong> — opening new opportunities to serve global brands
                            with the same structured creativity and fast-paced execution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            “I don’t just build projects — I build people. That’s where real transformation happens.”

                            Today, Kreassi Team continues to evolve, offering scalable creative services while
                            staying deeply human, collaborative, and driven by strategy.
